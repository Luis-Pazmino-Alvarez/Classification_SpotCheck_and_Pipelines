# Classification SpotCheck and Pipelines
Overview
This project demonstrates how to apply model spot-checking, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced pipeline techniques for classification problems using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It builds upon standard machine learning workflow concepts and applies them specifically to classification tasks with multiple algorithms.

Key Features
Spot-checking multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc.)

Advanced ensemble models like Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting

Full ML pipeline with preprocessing (StandardScaler), training/test split, and evaluation

Cross-validation using KFold and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Evaluation metrics: accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

Dataset
Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Technologies Used
Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib
